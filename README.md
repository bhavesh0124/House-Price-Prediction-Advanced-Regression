House Price Prediction competition on kaggle.com, where you have a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) 
every aspect of c. 1500 residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
The aim is to predict the final price of houses. 
I submitted my estimates to the comptetition , resulting in a 1800th place among 5600 competitors, placing my solution in the "top 31%". 
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
(Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.) 


RMSE = 0.1344. The public Leaderboard is found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard
